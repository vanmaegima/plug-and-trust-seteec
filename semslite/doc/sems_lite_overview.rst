 SEMS Lite Overview (Only for SE051)
=================================================

SEMSLite enables the deployment and update of applets on SE in the field.
When the applets are being upgraded, the data of previous/new applet
remains inside the secure element only.
Thus it securely preserves the device applet data.

Note: SEMS Lite is only supported for SE051.
