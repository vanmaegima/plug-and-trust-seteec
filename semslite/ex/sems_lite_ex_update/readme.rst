=======================================================================

This application will update Applet through SEMS Lite agent.

In this demo, an update package, is pre-compiled into the example binary.  See :file:`SEMS_Lite_UpgradeTo_iotDev-6_1_0-20200729-01_A397.h`.   This file contans a byte array that is encoded in protobuf format. This demo will call API :cpp:type:`sems_lite_agent_load_package()` which will decode the stream and send update commands command to SE.

Note: This demo is used for OEF A397. If you use it for another OEF, you should update the header file with correct one.
